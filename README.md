### Description ###

This project is a web-based database application system, an Ocean Observation System.

An Ocean Observation System (OOS) is a computer information system that stores and processes different types of data for an ocean observatory. Those data are produced by a wide range of different sensors, placed at different locations. The sensor types include underwater cameras that capture images, underwater microphones that captures sound data, and a number of different sensors for scalar measurement of water temperature, oxygen concentration, salinity, conductivity, and others. Images and sound data are collected at irregular time points (when requested by a scientist or triggered by a motion sensor); scalar data is collected every hour.
